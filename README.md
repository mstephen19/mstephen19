## Hey, I'm Matt! 👋

**Pronouns**: He/Him/His

I'm a full-stack developer with a knack for learning new things very quickly, and a constant craving to learn new technologies and concepts (a developer never stops learning). I studied at UC Berkeley with their Full-Stack Flex bootcamp, where I not only learned web-development from the ground up (from CSS + jQuery all the way to complex applications with Apollo, React and Redux), but also how to effectively communicate in a development environment.

Currently, I work for [Apify](https://apify.com/) as an Automation Engineer + Senior Developer Advocate. My duties include writing & testing automation software and web crawlers for big-ticket customers, writing internal tooling & libraries, maintaining existing software, communicating & planning with customers, managing projects, and pushing the company's developer community forward.

Before software development, I had a job as an English teacher in Poland. Being a teacher was humbling, and allowed for me to refine my communication skills which I use daily in my current career to communicate complex ideas to my colleagues and coordinate and plan projects.

Originally I'm from the U.S., but now am living in the Czech Republic.
